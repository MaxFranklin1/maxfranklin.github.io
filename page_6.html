    <p>Overall I did have fun with this project but it wasn’t easy. This project was my first introduction to web development so I was pretty much going in blind. Considering my lack of experience, I think the website didn’t turn out too bad. I enjoyed working with and group and brain storming ideas for cool navigation bar and what not. HTML and CSS are quite powerful when combined so I was nice knowing not matter what idea we had, there is most definitely a way of doing it. I’m not exactly the most creative person in the world so I definitely had trouble trying to make my website look modern and appealing. I had visions of how I wanted my website to look but actually creating those visions were extremely difficult. I unfortunately had to cut a lot of my ideas just so I got just get the website to work properly. Trying to get the website to be 100% mobile friendly was a challenge as well but media queries came in to save to day. I think if I was going to do this project again I would definitely put more effort into the group discussion and brain storms. Even though I was attending these group meetings I wasn’t exactly talkative. As I mentioned this is my first entry to web dev so I didn’t have much input for the conversations. Overall I got the website working and made the whole thing mobile friendly so that’s a success in my book.</p>
